            <h3 class="fw-bold">India vs Pakistan - World Cup 2019</h3>
            <p>This match was an epic clash between India and Pakistan in the World Cup 2019, filled with thrilling moments and high tension.</p>
            <p>This match was held on June 16, 2019, at Old Trafford in Manchester, and was one of the most anticipated clashes in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. Whenever India and Pakistan face off in cricket, the game is bound to be more than just a match—it's a spectacle. This particular encounter was no different.</p>
            <p>India, led by Virat Kohli, was in excellent form, with a solid batting lineup that included the likes of Rohit Sharma, who was in sublime touch throughout the tournament. Sharma’s blistering knock of 140 off 113 balls, supported by KL Rahul and Kohli, set the tone for India, allowing them to post a formidable total of 336/5 in their 50 overs.</p>
            <p>Pakistan’s chase was hampered by rain and frequent loss of wickets. Despite a fighting fifty from Fakhar Zaman and a quickfire 62 from Babar Azam, Pakistan couldn't keep up with the required run rate. The rain eventually reduced their target, and they fell short by 89 runs under the DLS method, scoring 212/6 in 40 overs.</p>
            <p>This match was significant not only for its cricketing brilliance but also for the emotions, rivalries, and the overwhelming support from fans worldwide. India maintained their unbeaten World Cup record against Pakistan, extending their streak to 7-0.</p>

        <div class="match">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">England vs New Zealand - World Cup 2019 Final</h3>
            <p>The most dramatic World Cup final in history, where England clinched the title in a super over against New Zealand.</p>
            <p>The ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 final, held at Lord's on July 14, 2019, is widely regarded as one of the greatest cricket matches of all time. It was the first World Cup final to be decided by a Super Over, and it ultimately saw England lift their maiden World Cup trophy in the most dramatic fashion possible.</p>
            <p>England, led by Eoin Morgan, was chasing New Zealand’s modest total of 241, and the match seemed to be slipping away from them as they struggled against a disciplined Kiwi bowling attack. Ben Stokes, however, played one of the most memorable innings in World Cup history, scoring an unbeaten 84, taking the game to a nail-biting finish.</p>
            <p>In the final over, with England needing 15 runs, Stokes hit a crucial six and then fortuitously scored 4 more off an overthrown ball that deflected off his bat as he dived to complete a second run. England ended their innings tied with New Zealand at 241 runs.</p>
            <p>The match then went to a Super Over, where both teams again ended up tied with 15 runs each. However, England was declared the winner on the boundary count rule, having scored more boundaries throughout the match. This final is remembered for its intense drama, sportsmanship, and the sheer unpredictability that makes cricket so enthralling.</p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Australia vs South Africa - Semi-Final 1999</h3>
            <p>An unforgettable match in the 1999 World Cup semi-final that ended in a dramatic tie, sending Australia to the final.</p>
            <p>The 1999 World Cup semi-final between Australia and South Africa, held at Edgbaston on June 17, 1999, is considered one of the most extraordinary cricket matches ever played. It was a game that saw both teams go through an emotional rollercoaster, culminating in one of the most dramatic finishes in cricket history.</p>
            <p>Australia, led by Steve Waugh, batted first and managed a total of 213, thanks largely to a gritty 50 from Michael Bevan and some lower-order resistance. However, it was far from a commanding score, especially against a formidable South African side.</p>
            <p>South Africa's chase started well, with Herschelle Gibbs and Gary Kirsten laying a solid foundation. However, Shane Warne, in one of his most memorable performances, turned the game on its head with a brilliant spell of leg-spin bowling, taking 4 wickets for 29 runs.</p>
            <p>The match then swung back and forth, with Lance Klusener almost single-handedly bringing South Africa to the brink of victory. With just one run needed to win and four balls remaining, a mix-up between Klusener and Allan Donald resulted in a dramatic run-out, leading to the match being tied. However, Australia advanced to the final due to their superior net run rate in the earlier stages of the tournament.</p>
            <p>This semi-final is remembered not only for its thrilling finish but also for the tactical brilliance, mental toughness, and the gut-wrenching disappointment for South Africa, who missed out on what seemed to be a sure victory.</p>
